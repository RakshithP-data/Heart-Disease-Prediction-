# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
ðŸ«€ We will utilize machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various features such as cholesterol levels and chest pain type. For this purpose, weâ€™ll be working with a sample dataset to explore and understand how different machine learning models can be applied and to gain hands-on experience.
